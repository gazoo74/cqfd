cqfdrc(5) - project information config file
===

## DESCRIPTION

The **cqfdrc(5)** file at the root of your project contains the information
required to support project tooling. __samples/dot-cqfdrc__ is an example.

### The project section

**org**
: a short, lowercase name for the projectâ€™s parent organization.

**name**
: a short, lowercase name for the project.

Generated Docker images for your project will be named __$org_$name__.

### The build section

**command**
: the command (or list of commands) to be executed when cqfd is invoked. This
string will be passed as an argument to a classical bash -c "commands", within
the build container, to generate the build artefacts.

**files**
: an optional space-separated list of files generated by the build process that
we want to include inside a standard release archive.

**archive**
: the optional name of the release archive generated by cqfd. You can include
environment variable names, as well as the following template marks:
* **%Gh** - git short hash of last commit
* **%GH** - git long hash of last commit
* **%D3** - RFC3339 date (YYYY-MM-DD)
* **%Cf** - current cqfd flavor name (if any)
* **%Po** - value of the project.org configuration key
* **%Pn** - value of the project.name configuration key
* **%%** - a litteral '%' sign

By default, **cqfd(1)** will generate a release tarball named
__org-name.tar.xz__, where `org' and `name' come from the project's
configuration keys.

**flavors**
: the list of build flavors (see below). Each flavor has its own command just
like build.command.

## EXAMPLES

Here is a sample **.cqfdrc(5)** file:

    [project]
    org='fooinc'
    name='buildroot'

    [build]
    command='make foobar_defconfig && make && asciidoc README.FOOINC'
    files='README.FOOINC output/images/sdcard.img'
    archive='cqfd-%Gh.tar.xz'
